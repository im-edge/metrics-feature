IMEdge Metrics feature
======================

This feature wants to offer an unexcited pleasantly relaxed performance
graphing experience. Implemented as a thin and modern abstraction layer based
on matured technology it puts its ma  in focus on robustness and ease of use.

Performance Graphing should "just work" out of the box. We do not assume that
our users carry a data science degree. Based on our field experience with Open
Source monitoring solutions, we make strong assumptions on what your preferences
might be. While it of course allows for customization, it ships with opinionated,
preconfigured data retention rules. You CAN care, but you do not have to.
